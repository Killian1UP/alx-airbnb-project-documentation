# 📄 Backend Feature Requirements – Airbnb Clone

This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for three core backend features of the Airbnb Clone project:

1. User Management  
2. Property Listings Management  
3. Booking Management

These requirements are structured to guide development, testing, and integration with frontend or mobile clients.

---

## 1️⃣ User Management

### 🔐 Feature Overview

Enables guests and hosts to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles securely.

---

### 🧩 Endpoints

#### 1.1 Register User  
**POST** `/api/users/register/`

##### 🔸 Request
```json
{
  "role": "guest",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "password": "securePass123"
}

🔸 Response (201 Created)
json
{
  "user_id": "usr_101",
  "role": "guest",
  "token": "JWT_TOKEN"
}
✅ Validation Rules
Unique email address

Password length ≥ 8 characters

Role must be either guest or host

1.2 User Login
POST /api/users/login/

🔸 Request
json
{
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "password": "securePass123"
}
🔸 Response (200 OK)
json
{
  "token": "JWT_TOKEN",
  "user": {
    "user_id": "usr_101",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "role": "guest"
  }
}
✅ Validation Rules
Correct email/password combo

Blocked accounts must not receive tokens

1.3 Update Profile
PATCH /api/users/profile/

🔸 Request
json
{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "contact": "+2784000000",
  "profile_photo": "base64string"
}
🔸 Response (200 OK)
json
{
  "message": "Profile updated successfully"
}
⚙️ Performance Considerations
Use indexed fields for fast user lookup.

Store passwords using bcrypt or Argon2.

Token expiry and refresh strategy (e.g., 1-hour access + 7-day refresh).

Throttle login attempts (rate limiting).

2️⃣ Property Listings Management
🧩 Feature Overview
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings.

🧩 Endpoints
2.1 Create Listing
POST /api/properties/

🔸 Request
json
{
  "title": "Beach House",
  "description": "A beautiful house by the sea.",
  "location": "Cape Town",
  "price_per_night": 1500,
  "amenities": ["Wi-Fi", "Pool"],
  "availability": {
    "start": "2025-08-01",
    "end": "2025-08-31"
  }
}
🔸 Response (201 Created)
json
{
  "property_id": "prop_201",
  "status": "active"
}
✅ Validation Rules
Title and description required

Price must be ≥ 1

Location must not be empty

2.2 Edit Listing
PUT /api/properties/{property_id}/

🔸 Request
json
{
  "price_per_night": 1700,
  "amenities": ["Wi-Fi", "Pool", "Parking"]
}
🔸 Response (200 OK)
json
{
  "message": "Listing updated"
}
2.3 Delete Listing
DELETE /api/properties/{property_id}/

🔸 Response (204 No Content)
⚙️ Performance Considerations
Full-text search index on location, title.

Use PostgreSQL JSON fields for flexible amenities storage.

Pagination and filtering for host dashboards.

3️⃣ Booking Management
🧩 Feature Overview
Guests can book properties for available dates, view status, and cancel if needed.

🧩 Endpoints
3.1 Create Booking
POST /api/bookings/

🔸 Request
json
{
  "property_id": "prop_201",
  "start_date": "2025-08-10",
  "end_date": "2025-08-14"
}
🔸 Response (201 Created)
json
{
  "booking_id": "bk_301",
  "status": "pending",
  "total_price": 6000.00
}
✅ Validation Rules
start_date ≥ today

end_date > start_date

Property must be available (no overlapping bookings)

Guest cannot book their own listing

3.2 Cancel Booking
DELETE /api/bookings/{booking_id}/cancel/

🔸 Response (200 OK)
json
{
  "status": "canceled"
}
3.3 Get Booking Details
GET /api/bookings/{booking_id}/

🔸 Response
json
{
  "status": "confirmed",
  "guest_id": "usr_101",
  "property": {
    "title": "Beach House"
  },
  "start_date": "2025-08-10",
  "end_date": "2025-08-14"
}
📊 Booking Statuses
Status	Description
pending	Booking created but not confirmed
confirmed	Payment confirmed
canceled	Canceled by guest/host
completed	Booking period has ended

⚙️ Performance Considerations
Use transactions to prevent race conditions.

Index bookings by property_id, start_date, end_date.

Use date range queries with exclusion logic for availability checks.

Optional Redis caching for hot property calendars.

✅ Summary
This document defines the foundation for backend implementation of three key modules. All endpoints must return appropriate status codes, error messages, and follow security best practices (e.g., input sanitization, JWT verification, RBAC).

Let’s continue evolving this documentation as new modules (e.g., Payments, Reviews, Notifications) are developed.
